##SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IN ASIA - STUDY & TRAVEL IN SUMMER 2018

**Studying abroad is once-in-a-lifetime experience, and it's something that can positively impact both your personal and professional future.** Many students who have studied abroad report afterwards that it was one of the best experiences in their whole life.

Maybe you already know this and you've dreamed about studying abroad, but committing to a full semester or academic abroad just doesn't fit your plans.

You might want to graduate quickly and may also have other reasons why setting off to a foreign country for a lengthy period of time just doesn't seem feasible.

If that is the case for you, there is an option for you that doesn't require that you set aside your life at home for several months at a time. **By joining an international summer school**, you get to experience a new country, learn the basics of a new language, gain friends from all over the world and take some interesting courses at the same time, all within just a month.

A summer school is an effective way to combine exploring a new country and studying. It's more than just sightseeing and lying on a beach, more than just sitting in front of a pile of books the whole summer. You get to take a break from your familiar environment while also feeling that you're doing something productive:

- You get to know a new country and culture better than a mere tourist
- You learn things you wouldn't be able to learn at home, both in- and outside the classroom
- You earn academic credits which you can include into your degree back home
- You get to know people from all over the world
- A summer school looks good in your CV and showcases to your future employers that you are active and make good use of your time
