Did you know you can make art by programming?<br>
Don't have programming experience? No problem!

Graffathon is a three-day computer graphics hackathon aimed for novices. Every participant will create a computer program that produces a non-interactive multimedia presentation also known as demo. The event is targeted at real beginners who have no previous graphics coding and/or demoscene experience. However there is an advanced "compo" aimed for those who have already made a demo at some point of their lives or for those who feel they are not beginners. The demos can be made in small groups of two to four people. One can also make the demo by themselves or find a group at the event.

The program consists of helpful presentations and workshops which guide you on how to create your first demo. In addition, we teach you the basics of demoscene and democulture.

The event is for people over 18.
